This is the newer code which has all of the final project things.

I didn't get a chance to record my proper lvl 3 video before the submission deadline, but the code is here and I have given you my video that had the encoder wire brooke off, which I didn't know at the time. 

I am still here for consultation for what I have done and achieved.
